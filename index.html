  <section id="about">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>  
      I am a sophomore at the University of Oregon pursuing a double major in Data Science and Computer Science, with minors in Business Administration and Mathematics. My academic background has provided me with a strong technical foundation in programming languages like Python, Java, and C, as well as data analysis and machine learning. I am passionate about solving real-world problems through software development and data-driven insights.   
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside the classroom, I enjoy staying active and pushing myself. I played varsity basketball in high school and continue to play intramural sports at the university. Sports and working out are an integral part of my life, helping me build discipline, stay in shape, and relieve stress at the same time. Additionally, I am an active member of the Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity, where I have cultivated leadership skills and a sense of community through collaborating with my peers.
